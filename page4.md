      <p>The city is linked to the rest of France by the French national motorway network and its airport is the second-largest in 
        the country, and it is also connected to the capital, Paris, by high-speed train. This accessibility makes it all the more 
        desirable to tourists, and thus the city is a major economic influence in the region
